Notice that once we choose X, we are not allowed to change X and we should sort the entire array around it.
With this constraint we can safely tell that, the array can be sorted as long as we choose X such that X is already in the correct position.
Hence we need to go through the array and count such numbers X such that it satisfies the above condition.
