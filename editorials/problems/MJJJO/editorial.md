**Tags**: Sorting


On visualizing the stacks, it can be seen that the crates fall to the right as long as there's no other crate
preventing this right-ward movement. 

Following this visualization, the tallest stack will be the rightmost one, followed by the 2nd smallest one, in
non-decreasing order.

Hence, simply sorting the numbers would do the trick.
