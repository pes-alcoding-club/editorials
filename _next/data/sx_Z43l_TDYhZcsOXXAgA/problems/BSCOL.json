The recurrence can be built by noticing that at each school you have 3 options to go to.</li>\n<li>This solution does not pass for large testcases due to the size of the inputs. Here we can notice that schools A, B and C are essentially the same.\nWe can reorient the problem to one with 2 states, D or ABC and you can stay at the ABC state for multiple minutes.\nSo we can reject a DP solution and solve the problem using pure math and combinatorics.\nAt T = 0 (in 0 minutes), the number of ways to get to D and back is 1, while the number of ways to get from A, B or C to D is 0.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At an instance of X units of time,</p>\n<p>The number of ways to get to D at X minutes is => 3 * (number of ways to get to A, B, C at X - 1 minutes)</p>\n<p>The number of ways to get to A, B or C at X minutes is => (number of ways to get to D at X - 1 minutes) + 2 * (number of ways to get to A, B or C at X - 1 minutes), since you are already at either A, B or C.</p>\n<p>Also make sure to use modular arithmetic.</p>\n<p>Time Complexity: O(N)</p>\n<p>Space Complexity: O(1)</p>\n","solutions":{"cpp":"#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n#define ll long long\n#define endl \"\\n\"\nconst long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);\n  cin.tie(0);\n  int Q;\n  cin >> Q;\n  while (Q--) {\n    ll T;\n    cin >> T;\n    ll prevD = 1, prevABC = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < T; i++) {\n      ll temp = ((3 % MOD) * (prevABC)) % MOD;\n      prevABC = ((prevD % MOD) + (((2 % MOD) * (prevABC % MOD)) % MOD)) % MOD;\n      prevD = temp;\n    }\n    cout << prevD << endl;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n"},"problemData":{"id":"BSCOL","title":"Travelling Students","difficulty":"medium","problem_url":"https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/alcoding-june-challenge-2021/challenges/b-schools"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
